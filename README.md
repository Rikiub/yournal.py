## Usage

This is a Python script, so you need to have Python installed on your system (duh).

If you are on Linux or MacOS, running the script is as easy as:

```shell
./yournal.py
```

For Windows:

```shell
python yournal.py
```

The daily note will be opened with your `EDITOR` variable. If this fails, the default text editor of your system will be used.

See `--help` for more information or [configuration](#configuration) to configure it.

### CLI (Command Line Interface)

```
usage: yournal [-d DIRECTORY] [-t TEMPLATE] [-h] [-i] [-s] [-e EDITOR]

Fast (y)ournal script to make Daily Notes on your terminal.

paths:
  -d DIRECTORY, --directory DIRECTORY
                        directory where save your daily notes
  -t TEMPLATE, --template TEMPLATE
                        template file to parse. recommended use a markdown file

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i, --ignore          ignore environment variables.
  -s, --skip            skip dynamic templates parse
  -e EDITOR, --editor EDITOR
                        use a custom editor command

By default, yournal uses these environment variables when no arguments are provided:
    YOURNAL_DIR for DIRECTORY
    YOURNAL_TEMPLATE for TEMPLATE

Dynamic templates supported: True

To parse "dynamic variables" in templates you need to have the Python "arrow" package installed. You can install it with pip:
    pip install arrow

    The "Obsidian Templates" syntax is supported for now.
```

## Install

First clone this repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Rikiub/yournal.py.git
```

And add the `yournal.py` file to your system **PATH**. For example, a common Linux user **PATH** is: *~/.local/bin*

> Rename `yournal.py` to `yournal` if you want a short command.

### Optional dependences

For [templating support](#templating) you need install the [arrow](https://github.com/arrow-py/arrow) package. You can install it with pip:

```shell
pip install arrow
```

## Templates

Yeah, that's support templates! Both static and dynamic. To use templates you must specify a file with the `-t` flag:

```
yournal.py -t path/to/template
```

Also, you need install [this](#optional-dependences) to enable dynamic templates support.

For now, dynamic templates follow the [Obsidian Templates](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Templates#Template+variables) syntax.

### Explaining dynamic templates

What is a *dynamic template*? A template with replaceable variables. For example, we have this `template.md` file:

```md
# {{date}}

My friend Mike is going to the beach on {{date:YYYY}} at {{time}} in the afternoon...
```

When we run the script using `template.md` as template, everything surrounded by `{{}}` will be replaced by the following:

```
# 2023-09-20

My friend Mike is going to the beach in 2023 at 15:47 in the afternoon....
```

## Configuration

By default, `yournal.py` will create the daily notes in the current working directory. To change this behavior, you need to set these environment variables on your system:

- `YOURNAL_DIR` for the directory where the Daily Notes will be saved.
- `YOURNAL_TEMPLATE` for the [template](#templating) file to use.
